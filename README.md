## Project Intro
In an era where managing space occupancy is crucial for both safety and efficiency, our
project embarks on solving a pertinent problem: accurately counting and monitoring the number
of people in designated regions of interest. This challenge, prevalent in scenarios ranging from
public events to private gatherings, demands a solution that is not only precise but also adaptable
to different environments. This solution offers a number of uses case capabilities.
- Monitor the count of people in various zones within a site and get predictable analytics
for customer arrival pattern
- Controlling maximum entry numbers in a particular area and thereby adhere to social
distancing guidelines
- Capture images/video for a customerâ€™s demographics or interest profile, their shopping
journey to get analytics
- Ability to understand busiest and quietest hours
- Set queue occupancy levels, no. of cash counters and measure customer billing/ service
time
- Set and receive alerts and/or notifications via audio, visual, email or text when these
capacity limits are approaching or reached

## Project Assignment 4.2 submission
- Submitted 11/20/23
- Christi set meeting #3 for 11/22/23 @ 6:00 PM
## Meeting 3
- Approve the project for the IoT device
- Discuss the approach to Strategy, Design, and Execution
- Assign tasks: Christi to work on documentation of the strategy and code review, Adam to work on code and IoT design, Reed to work on documentation of the design.
- GitHub has been updated and linked into the Colob code
- Next call and due dates set for 11/28/23 @ 5:00 PM PST.
## Code progress
- Test MP4 have been coded to count people in an ROI and assign tranction direction along with confidence scores
- Still need to review issue with identifying the confidence scores on people that no tranction was identified
- Once design for camera use is completed the code will follow
- Initial IoT design is in place, based on Camera, Lidar, Sound, and CO2 sensors.
- Create and export Excel data file for using as a dataset for a monitoring system
## Documentation
- Initial Project documentation is in place and shared
## Meeting 4
- Review project documentation
- Review code and question about:
-   - Frame size
    - Dynamic frame sizing
- Update documentation with IoT design
- Set meeting for 12/7/23 @ 5:00 PM
## Meeting 5
- Christi presented the Slides (PP)
- Dividing the presentations (C:1-3, A:4-6, R:7-9)
- Reed to review the code Adam made and add general camera code
- Christi to complete the Project documentation and review sections that Adam added
- Set up meeting for 12/9/23 @ 5:00 PM
